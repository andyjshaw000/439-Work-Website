                    Here is an image of my circuit working. The LEDs blink and turn on/off
                    depending on if I press the button.

                    Here I went with 300 ohms for the LEDs since I knew the Arduino provided
                    5 volts and the circuits were in series. The LEDs are recommended to be <br>
                    powered around 20 mA, so 5/.02 = 250 ohms and 330 ohms was the closest we had. I
                    did not want to go lower than 250 ohms, as I did not want to possibly <br>
                    short my LEDs. I went with a 10k ohm resistor for my switch to avoid an open
                    circuit and to keep the pin grounded when the switch is closed.
