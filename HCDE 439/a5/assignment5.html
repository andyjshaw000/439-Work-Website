                    Here is an gif of my circuit working. The LED strip's brightness will change
                    depending on how much resistance the capacitive sensor notices/ when I touch it.

                    By using an external power source that provided 12 volts, I was able
                    to power an LED strip. With the help of an N MOSFET
                    transistor with a drain current 32A and Arduino board
                    I was able to control how much voltage/current flowed between
                    the source and the drain. Since the LED strips have 3 white LEDs in series,
                    we know in an LED strip section, there will be 3 * 3.3 = 9.9 V drop since white LEDs
                    have a voltage drop of ~3.3 V. Since the power supply is 12 V, there is
                    a 12 - 9.9 = ~2.1 V drop across resistors in series with the three LEDs.
                    The resistors are marked 181, so 18 * 10 = 180 ohms. Since 2.1 = I * 180,
                    2.1/180 = 0.01166A, 11.66mA across one section of the strip.
                    There are 100 sections, which suggests 100 * 11.66 = ~1.17 A across the entire
                    load and circuit (before the transistor). On the right circuit, since I use a
                    1 megohm resistor for absolute touch, and 12 = I * 1000000, 12/1000000 =
                    0.000012A, .012mA is across the entire right circuit before it breaks off
                    into the sensor and sensor pin.
                    Using the CapacitiveSensor library, I used pins 4 and 2 to sense touch/
                    resistance.

                    Here is my code with comments explaining how it works. I use an array to average
                    the values of the capacitive sensor since it is very finicky and sensitive.
                    The array is populated with the values from the sensor and the loops takes an
                    average value of all the values in the array. I use the CapacitiveSensor
                    library.
