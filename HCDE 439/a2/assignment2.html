                    Here is an gif of my circuit working. The LEDs blink and turn on/off
                    depending on if I press the button.

                    In this circuit I used 2 different types of LEDs. The yellow LED has a
                    voltage drop of 1.8 v, and the white has a voltage drop of 3.3 v. I had to
                    choose resistors that provided the recommended 20 a. For the yellow LED's
                    resistor, I needed a (5 - 1.8) / .02 = 160 ohm resistor. The closest resistor
                    I had to this was 220 ohm (I went over to make sure  I didn't short the LED).
                    For the white LED's resistor, I needed a (5 - 3.3) / .02 = 85 ohm resistor.
                    The closest resistor I had to this was 100 ohm (I went over to make sure
                    I didn't short the LED). I went with a 10k ohm resistor for my switch to
                    avoid an open circuit and to keep the pin grounded when the switch is closed.
