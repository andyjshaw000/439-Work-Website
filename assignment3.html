                    Here is an image of my circuit working. The LED fades depending on the input
                    from the photoresistor. The LED will turn off for two seconds if it has been
                    on for too long.

                    The yellow LED has a voltage drop of 1.8 v. I had to
                    choose resistors that provided the recommended 20 a. For the yellow LED's <br>
                    resistor, I needed a (5 - 1.8) / .02 = 160 ohm resistor. The closest resistor
                    I had to this was 220 ohm (I went over to make sure  I didn't short the LED). <br>
                    I went with a 10k ohm resistor for my photoresistor as the voltage divider. This
                    allows for an accurate voltage drop across the photoresistor, which helps with
                    reading sensor values.
