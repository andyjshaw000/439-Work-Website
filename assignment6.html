                    Here is a gif of my circuit working. The circle on the screen will move based
                    on input received from the joystick.

                    Here is a another gif of my circuit working. The LED's brightness will fade
                    if the button has been toggled/pressed. When toggled on, the brightness of the
                    LED will increase until it reaches its max brightness, then resets. Toggling
                    will stop the LED at whatever brightness it is at.

                    The green LED has a voltage drop of 1.8 v. I had to
                    choose resistors that provided the recommended 20 a. For the green LED's
                    resistor, I needed a (5 - 1.8) / .02 = 160 ohm resistor. The closest resistor
                    I had to this was 220 ohm (I went over to make sure  I didn't short the LED).
                    The Arduino Uno has ADC resolution of 10 bits. Hence the values on
                    each analog channel can vary from 0 to 1023 and the home position for the joystick
                    is x: 511, y: 511. The joystick is powered
                    by 5V given through the arduino's pin.

                    Here is my code with comments explaining how it works. I read the values of
                    the joystick and write them to the serial monitor in the form of an array in
                    each line. The code checks to see if there is any communication from serial and
                    if there is, it will adjust the LED's brightness to be whatever data is read
                    from serial.

                    This code connects the serial port to an html webpage that uses p5.js.
                    The code will log the status of the port during setup to the
                    console.
                    I added a button with an event listener and timer to toggle if I want my LED
                    lit up or not. I send this data over through the serial port to arduino.
                    The code will finally draw on the page a circle that moves around
                    based on input received from the arduino by parsing what the arduino serial
                    sends, which should look like an array every line. I multiply and divide the
                    values of the array when changing the ellipse's position from joystick input
                    since the joystick inputs values from 0 - 1023 and I needed the ellipse to
                    fit on the page. remainingSeconds is limited from 0 - 255 because analogWrite()
                    on the arduino can only work with values from 0 - 255
