                Here I went with 300 ohms for each LED since I knew the Arduino provided
                5 volts and the circuits were in series. The LEDs are recommended to be
                powered around 20 mA, so 5/.02 = 250 ohms and 330 ohms was the closest we had. I
                did not want to go lower than 250 ohms, as I did not want to possibly
                short my LEDs.
