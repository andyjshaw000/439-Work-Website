                    Here is an image of my circuit working and alternating LEDs
                    like a traffic light.

                    Here I went with 300 ohms for each LED since I knew the Arduino provided
                    5 volts and the circuits were in series. The LEDs are recommended to be <br>
                    powered around 20 mA, so 5/.02 = 250 ohms and 330 ohms was the closest we had. I
                    did not want to go lower than 250 ohms, as I did not want to possibly
                    short my LEDs.
