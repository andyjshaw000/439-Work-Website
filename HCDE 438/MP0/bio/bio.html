        <p id="desc">Meet me, a 22-year-old student at the University of Washington where
          I am currently studying Human Centered Design & Engineering and Computer Science.
          I enjoy both social and solitary activities.
          When I am not busy with schoolwork, I can be found out and about trying new
          restaurants with friends or exploring the great outdoors through skateboarding, hiking,
          and bouldering. In my free time, I also enjoy playing video games with friends.
          With my unique combination of technical and design skills, I am poised to make a
          real impact in the tech industry.</p>
