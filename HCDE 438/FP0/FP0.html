          <div class="text">For my final, I will add saving the user's high score and if they've completed the tutorial, a pause button, a magnet powerup, balances, different types of enemies, boss levels, a play again button, updated visuals, and the ability for the player choose between their first weapon being a sword or orb to my game from MP3.</div>

      <h2>Versions of the Game:</h2>
      <div class="text-container">
        <div>
          <h3>Prototype Version</h3>
          <div class="text">In my prototype version, I will be building off my current game. This should be easy because a lot of the stuff I will be adding during this phase are small adjustments. Adding a button is something I already know how to do and I also already have a way to present upgrades. Hannah suggested that I should refactor my code into other files while also cleaning up my code generally, such as using JSON to store data instead of global variables all the time.</div>
          <h3>Final Version</h3>
          <div class="text">In the final version, I expect "significant" changes. Gameplay will be different with new enemies of course because now it'll be very difficult for players to stand still and boss levels will change how players use their resources. The most difficult aspect of this phase is using a database. I watched how Hannah created one in class, but I am unfamiliar with the syntax and documentation of Firebase. Although it is not many lines of code, I really want to have an understanding of what is going on before I inject the code into my game.</div>
